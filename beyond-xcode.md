> Not all abstract interfaces can outperform a well-designed visual interface. (Just look at the amount of typing airline counter personnel have to do with their steam-powered computers to make a simple change.)

I haven't performed or reviewed a stopwatch test, but LaunchBar should be able to outperform a visual interface for complex, repetitive switching sequences by an expert user.
